The purpose of this site is to give the visitor a fun interactive quiz. This web application would be for anyone but especially any one who is a fan of the Marvel Universe. This is a place they can test there knowledge on some of there favourite characters annd see how much they really know. 

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

        2. I want to play an enjoyable quiz.
        3. I want to know when I get a questions wrong or right.
        4. When the quiz is over I would like to know how many I got right and recieve feed back.        

    -   #### Returning Users

        1. Easily navagate around the site.
        2. Take the same quiz again and recieve different questions.


-  ### Design

    -   #### Colour Scheme
         - The colour scheme I wanted for this quiz was to be bright and cheerful I achieved this by using a background of the Marvel characters.
         For the quiz area I gave the quiz selection boxes a light background as the user could tell clearly if they got the answer correct or incorrect and they are also slightly transparent for a better over all look. 

    -   #### Typography
        -   The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Roboto is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

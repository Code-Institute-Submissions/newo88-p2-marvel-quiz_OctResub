## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
        

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The three main colours i used are blue black and white. I keep the colour scheme simple as not to take away from the photos of the consoles. Most of the photos have a white background and the console's them selves are mainly black and white in colour. The background colour has a gradient of light blue to dark blue so when the user is scrolling down through the page its not just the same block colour. 

    -   #### Typography
        -   The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Roboto is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
